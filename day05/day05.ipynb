    "number 98 corresponds to soil number 50 and that seed number 99 corresponds to soil number 51.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second line means that the source range starts at 50 and contains 48 values: 50, 51, ..., 96, 97. This \n",

    "Any source numbers that aren't mapped correspond to the same destination number. So, seed number 10 corresponds\n",
